## What does it do?
With the Deadline Countdown app you're able to create and edit individual "tasks" or events to your liking.
The countdown's format is the main selling point of this app; it helps you visualize how long you have left to complete a project or run errands before a due date.

I personnally wanted my app to specifically display how long in hours I have before a deadline; I find it less overwhelming that way and it therefore helps me stay productive.

## Features I'm working on and planning to implement to the final product
- Widgets to add to homescreen
- Notifications Xh or Xmin before due date and once the countdown reaches its end (option to enable in settings)
- Multiple color themes to pick from in settings

### Features I will **not** implement
- Ability to tick off tasks once they're done
- To do lists within each task (You're still able to write a list of things to do in the description of each task if you so wish)
  
## How can I use it? Where can I install it?
